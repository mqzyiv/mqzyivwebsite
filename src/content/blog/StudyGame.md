#### Inspiration
We wanted to build something that makes studying fun and interactive, so we took inspiration from Bitcamp's dinosaurs and created an adorable and engaging way to study readings!
#### What it does
Knowledge Quest takes in the user's reading and uses Gemini to generate five questions to test the user's knowledge. To spice things up, the user can choose one of four elemental dinos and answer questions to defeat enemy dinos. The app checks for accuracy and provides the relevant portions of the text for review.
#### How we built it
We used Figma to visualize our app and Pygame. We used PixilArt to design all visuals and Cats on Mars by SEATBELTS for the background music.

One of our teammembers also made a React version of the application.

#### Challenges we ran into
We ran into challenges throughout the hackathon including limitations of the pygame package for the implementation of features we had in mind.

#### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are extremely proud of our visual elements! They are adorable!! Our teammembers did all of the pixel art themselves and it really added to the look of our project. We also composed our own instrumental backing for the project, which was a fun touch.

We are also proud of completing our user flow the way we envisioned it.

#### What we learned
We learned a lot about pygame, the use of Gemini in code, and how pygame compares with React.

#### What's next for Knowledge Quest
We would like to incorporate the opportunity for user's to retry question that they previously missed so that they get a chance for redemption.
